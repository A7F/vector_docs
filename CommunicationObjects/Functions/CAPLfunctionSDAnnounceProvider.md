### Function Syntax

- `long SD_AnnounceProvider(serviceProviderRef * provider); // form 1`
- `void SD_AnnounceProvider(providedServiceRef * providedService); // form 2`

### Description

Note that the provider will be automatically announced if you call **ProvideService** on the endpoint.

### Parameters

- **providedService**: Service provided by an endpoint for a consumer.

### Return Values

- **0**: Success
- **1**: Provider endpoint is not simulated
- **< 0**: Other error

### Example

```c
SD_AnnounceProvider(newProvider);
```
