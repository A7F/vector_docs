## Description

Sets the receiver endpoint for the CO reference.

## Parameters

- **receiverPath (form 1)**: Full path to a receiver endpoint of the referenced object, including all namespaces.
- **receiverIndex (form 2)**: 0-based index of a receiver endpoint of the referenced object.
- **participant (form 3)**: A participant which contains a receiver endpoint of the referenced object.

## Return Values

- **0**: Success
- **4**: Given endpoint is not of the referenced object (form 1)
- **5**: Given participant contains no fitting endpoint of the referenced object (form 3)
- **7**: Index is invalid (form 2)
- **9**: Trying to set a receiver for a txSignalRef or txPDURef where the signal / PDU is for broadcast communication
- **-1**: Object is invalid
