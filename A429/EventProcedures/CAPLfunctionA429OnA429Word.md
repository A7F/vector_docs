# on a429word

**Valid for**: CANoe DE â€¢ CANoe4SW DE

**Note**  
CAPL programs are by default not transparent to bus events. This means that a CAPL node in the evaluation branch of the measurement setup will block the data flow to its right side. You must explicitly code the forwarding of messages in CAPL nodes in the evaluation branch. In order to re-use this code snippet in Simulation Setup of your CANoe DE product you have to add conditional compilation. Otherwise a recursion will occur.

Forward ARINC word event:

```plaintext
on a429word * {
  #if MEASUREMENT_SETUP
  output(this);
  #endif
}
```

## Description

The event procedure `on a429word` is called on every event, related to an error free ARINC word.
