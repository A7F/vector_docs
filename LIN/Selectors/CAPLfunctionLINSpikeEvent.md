## Table of Keywords

- **Keyword:** Time
  - **Description:** Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or PC system clock). Unit: 10µs
  - **Type:** dword
  - **Access Limitations:** read only

- **Keyword:** MsgOrigTime
  - **Description:** Time stamp generated by the LIN hardware. This time stamp is unsynchronized with the global time base on the computer and thus still original. It can be used to compare the time of two LIN hardware generated events. Unit: 10µs
  - **Type:** dword
  - **Access Limitations:** read only

- **Keyword:** MsgTimeStampStatus
  - **Description:** Status of MsgOrigTime:
    - Bit 0 set: Time stamp is valid
    - Bit 0 not set: Time stamp is invalid
    - Bit 1 set: Time stamp was generated by software
    - Bit 1 not set: Time stamp was generated by hardware
    - Bit 4: Has a bus-specific meaning; not currently in use for LIN
  - **Type:** byte
  - **Access Limitations:** read only

- **Keyword:** MsgChannel
  - **Description:** Channel through which the checksum error has been received. Value range: 1..32
  - **Type:** word
  - **Access Limitations:** read only

- **Keyword:** length_ns
  - **Description:** Length of the spike in nanoseconds.
  - **Type:** int64
  - **Access Limitations:** read only

- **Keyword:** lin_External
  - **Description:** Indicates whether the spike was:
    - received by an external device (selector set) or
    - transmitted by the LIN hardware itself (selector not set).
  - **Type:** byte
  - **Access Limitations:** read only
