### Keywords and Descriptions

- **Time**
  - Description: Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or PC system clock). 
  - Unit: 10µs
  - Type: dword
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **Time_ns**
  - Description: Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or PC system clock). 
  - Unit: nanoseconds
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **MsgOrigTime**
  - Description: Time stamp generated by the LIN hardware. This time stamp is unsynchronized with the global time base on the computer and thus still original. It can be used to compare the time of two LIN hardware generated events.
  - Unit: 10µs
  - Type: dword
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **MsgTimeStampStatus**
  - Description: Status of MsgOrigTime:
    - Bit 0 set: Time stamp is valid
    - Bit 0 not set: Time stamp is invalid
    - Bit 1 set: Time stamp was generated by software
    - Bit 1 not set: Time stamp was generated by hardware
    - Bit 4: Has a bus-specific meaning; not currently in use for LIN
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **LIN_HeaderTime**
  - Description: Frame header transmission time.
  - Unit: bit time
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **LIN_Fulltime**
  - Description: Entire event transmission time (transmission of the frame header by the master and waiting for the maximum frame duration).
  - Unit: bit time
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **ID**
  - Description: LIN Frame identifier (6 bits)
  - Value range: 0..63
  - Type: byte

- **DLC**
  - Description: Number of data bytes contained in the frame (Data Length Code).
  - Value range: 0..8
  - Type: byte

- **MsgChannel**
  - Description: Transmission channel or channel through which the frame has been received.
  - Value range: 1..32
  - Type: word

- **DIR**
  - Description: Direction of transmission:
    - Tx: Frame was transmitted by LIN hardware
    - RX: Frame was received
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **SIMULATED**
  - Description: This flag specifies whether the frame was simulated.
  - Values:
    - 0: Not simulated
    - 1: Simulated
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **RTR**
  - Description: This flag is only required when a frame is being sent with [output()](../Functions/CAPLfunctionLINOutput.md).
  - Meaning:
    - 0: Response data will be reconfigured.
    - 1: Frame header is applied to the bus - only works with the LIN hardware in Master mode.
  - Type: byte

- **Byte(x)**
  - Description: Frame data byte (8 bit).
  - Possible values for x: 0..7
  - Type: byte

- **Word(x)**
  - Description: Frame data word (16 bit).
  - Possible values for x: 0-6. The index is byte-oriented. For example, word(1) references the data consisting of bytes 1-2 and not of bytes 2-3.
  - Type: word

- **dword(x)**
  - Description: Frame data double word (32 bit).
  - Possible values for x: 0-4. The index is byte-oriented. For example, dword(1) references the data consisting of bytes 1-4 and not of bytes 4-7.
  - Type: dword

- **breakLen**
  - Description: Length of the sync break in ns
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **delimiterLen**
  - Description: Length of the sync delimiter in ns
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **EOH**
  - Description: End of header time stamp in ns
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **EOB[i]**
  - Description: End of byte time stamp of databyte <i> in ns 
  - Possible indexes: 0..7
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **SOF**
  - Description: Start of Frame time stamp in ns
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **HeaderBaudrate**
  - Description: The measured baudrate of the LIN header of this event.
  - Unit: Bit/s
  - Type: double
  - Access Limitations: read only
