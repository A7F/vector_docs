## Keywords and Descriptions

- **Time**
  - Description: Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or PC system clock).
  - Unit: 10µs
  - Type: dword
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **Time_ns**
  - Description: Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or PC system clock).
  - Unit: nanoseconds
  - Type: int64
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **MsgOrigTime**
  - Description: Time stamp generated by the LIN hardware. This time stamp is unsynchronized with the global time base on the computer and thus still original. It can be used to compare the time of two LIN hardware generated events.
  - Unit: 10µs
  - Type: dword
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **MsgTimeStampStatus**
  - Description: Status of MsgOrigTime:
    - Bit 0 set: Time stamp is valid
    - Bit 0 not set: Time stamp is invalid
    - Bit 1 set: Time stamp was generated by software
    - Bit 1 not set: Time stamp was generated by hardware
    - Bit 4: Has a bus-specific meaning; not currently in use for LIN
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **MsgChannel**
  - Description: Channel through which the event was received.
  - Value range: 1..32
  - Type: word
  - Access Limitations: 

- **lin_WasAwake**
  - Description: Indicates which status the LIN hardware was in before the LinSleepModeEvent occurred:
    - In Awake status (selector set)
    - In Sleep status (selector not set)
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **lin_IsAwake**
  - Description: Indicates the current state of the LIN hardware:
    - In Awake status (selector set)
    - In Sleep status (selector not set)
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **lin_External**
  - Description: Indicates whether the change of state is the result of
    - an external event (selector set)
    - an internal reason (selector not set)
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only

- **lin_Reason**
  - Description: This value indicates the reason for an event. A variety of values can be transferred.
    - General values: 
      - 0: Start state
    - Values upon transition to Sleep mode:
      - 1: SleepModeFrame
      - 2: BusIdle Timeout
      - 3: Silent SleepMode" command (for shortening the BusIdle Timeout)
    - Values upon leaving Sleep mode:
      - 9: External Wakeup signal
      - 10: Internal Wakeup signal
      - 11: Bus traffic (can only occur if the LIN hardware does not have a Master function)
    - Values if the LIN hardware does not go into Sleep mode in spite of request to do so:
      - 18: Bus traffic (can only occur if the LIN hardware does not have a Master function)
  - Type: byte
  - Access Limitations: read only
