## Table of Selectors

- **Keyword**: Time
  - **Description**: Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or computer system clock). Unit: 10µs
  - **Type**: dword
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: Time_ns
  - **Description**: Time stamp synchronized with the global time base on the computer (CAN hardware or computer system clock). Unit: nanoseconds
  - **Type**: int64
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: MsgOrigTime
  - **Description**: Time stamp generated by the LIN hardware. This time stamp is unsynchronized with the global time base on the computer and thus still original. It can be used to compare the time of two LIN hardware generated events. Unit: 10µs
  - **Type**: dword
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: MsgTimeStampStatus
  - **Description**: Status of MsgOrigTime:
    - Bit 0 set: Time stamp is valid
    - Bit 0 not set: Time stamp is invalid
    - Bit 1 set: Time stamp was generated by software
    - Bit 1 not set: Time stamp was generated by hardware
    - Bit 4: Has a bus-specific meaning; not currently in use for LIN
  - **Type**: byte
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: MsgChannel
  - **Description**: Channel through which the event was received. Value range: 1..32
  - **Type**: word
  - **Access Limitations**:

- **Keyword**: lin_Signal
  - **Description**: Signal actually received. Because of different baudrates of transmitter and receiver in Sleep state, this signal can take on the legal values 0x00, 0x80 (signal actually transmitted) and 0xC0.
  - **Type**: byte
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: lin_External
  - **Description**: indicates whether the wake-up signal was
    - received by an external device (selector set) or
    - transmitted by the LIN hardware itself (selector not set).
  - **Type**: byte
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: length_ns
  - **Description**: Length of the wake-up signal in ns.
  - **Type**: int64
  - **Access Limitations**: read only

- **Keyword**: SOF
  - **Description**: Start of wake-up signal time stamp in ns
  - **Type**: int64
  - **Access Limitations**: read only
