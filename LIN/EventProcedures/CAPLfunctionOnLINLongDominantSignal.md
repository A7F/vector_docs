## Description

The event procedure `on linLongDominantSignal` is called when the LIN hardware detects a long dominant signal on the bus (i.e. a dominant signal longer than a valid wake-up frame).

The keyword this and the selectors (see Option .LIN: `linLongDominantSignal` selectors) can be used to access the data of the event that has just been received.
