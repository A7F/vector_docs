# SerialReceive

**Valid for**: CANoe DE â€¢ CANoe:lite DE

**Note:** The function can only be called on system variable namespaces of channels that represent an external power supply in a power module **VT7001** respectively the system variable namespace that represents functionality common for the entire **VT7001** module.

## Method Syntax

`long SysVarNamespace.SerialReceive( byte buffer[], dword size);`

## Description

Starts receiving blocks of bytes from the serial port of the specified **VT7001** channel. Received data is copied to the specified buffer. The data can only be accessed in the [OnSerialReceive](CAPLfunctionVTSOnSerialReceive.md) callback.

- The operation works continuous if issued once
- If another receive operation will be given, the result buffer will change to that one given by the last receive operation.
- A callback handler has to be set for notification when data has been received. See [SerialSetOnReceiveHandler](CAPLfunctionVTSSerialSetOnReceiveHandler.md).
- Another callback handler can be set to notify of errors in later stages of the send operation. See [SerialSetOnErrorHandler](CAPLfunctionVTSSerialSetOnErrorHandler.md).

The used serial port has to be opened first.

## Parameters

- **buffer**: An array of bytes where received data is copied to. The buffer is only valid within the [OnSerialReceive](CAPLfunctionVTSOnSerialReceive.md) callback.
- **number**: Maximum number of Bytes which can be received at a time. Must have a value > 0 and < 65.

## Return Values

- **0**: Successful call
- **-1**: Non-specific error
- **-2**: The namespace on which the command was called does not exist, is not a valid **VT System** namespace or does not support this command.
- **-3**: One of the parameters has an invalid value.
- **-5**: Serial port is not open.
