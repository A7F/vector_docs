# Example

[Valid for](../../../Shared/FeatureAvailability.md): CANoe DE • CANoe:lite DE • CANoe4SW DE • CANoe4SW:lite DE

When one of the following events occurs (Message with ID 100 is received, key a is pressed, or Timer Clock_1 elapses) then, in this example:

- an [on message](../../CAN/EventProcedures/CAPLfunctionOnMessage.md) procedure,
- an [on key](CAPLfunctionOnKey.md) procedure or
- an [on timer](CAPLfunctionOnTimer.md) procedure is called.

In doing so, an appropriate text is always output to the Write Window by the [write](../Functions/CAPLfunctionWrite.md) function.
