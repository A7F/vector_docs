# MOST: Error Codes of CAPL Functions

[Valid for](../../Shared/FeatureAvailability.md): CANoe DE

- **kMostOK = 0**: No Error occurred.
- **kMostInvalidChannel = -1**: The operation was requested for an invalid channel number.
- **kMostNoConnection = -2**: The driver was unable to establish a connection to the MOST interface hardware. Check the connection settings in the [Hardware Configuration](../../CANoeCANalyzer/Ribbon/Hardware/NetworkHardware.md) dialog under the menu path **Configuration|Hardware Configuration**.
- **kMostIllegalTime = -3**: The function was called in the wrong phase of the measurement. For example, the OptoLyzer mode can only be changed in the ‘preStart’ function.
- **kMostWrongThread = -4**: For technical reasons, this function may not be called from this area of CANoe DE. Not all functions can be called from CAPL nodes in the analyzing setup.
- **kMostWrongHWMode = -5**: The network interface to the MOST bus is in a state in which the called function is unavailable.
- **kMostTxQueueFull = -6**: The transmit queue of 256 Messages is full, while trying to send another message.
- **kMostHWBusy = -7**: Unable to perform the desired action due to hardware overload.
- **kMostWrongHWType = -8**: This functionality is not supported by the hardware used.
- **kMostParameterOutOfRange = -9**: One or more function parameters lie outside of their valid value ranges.
- **kMostDriverCallFailed = -10**: The MOST hardware driver returned an error. Please make sure that the driver has been properly installed and that the hardware is operationally ready.
- **kMostAsInvalidChannel = -21**: The function was called for an invalid channel.
- **kMostAsDoubleOp = -22**: The function cannot be executed, because its results already apply. (e.g., a CAPL node has already been registered in the Local FBlockList)
- **kMostAsIllegalTime = -23**: The function cannot be executed in this phase of the simulation cycle.
- **kMostAsParamNotAvailable = -24**: The requested parameter value is unavailable.
- **kMostAsNotAvailable = -25**: The function is unavailable or the MOST Application Socket is inactive.
- **kMostAsBeforeNetOn = -26**: This function cannot be called before NetOn.
- **kMostAsInvalidParameter = -29**: At least one parameter passed with the function lies outside of its valid value range.
- **kMostXML4CAPLGeneralExecError = -30**: General execution error.
- **kMostXML4CAPLUnknownMsg = -31**: The specified message cannot be dissolved with the available function catalogs.
- **kMostXML4CAPLMsgSizeExceeded = -32**: The function cannot be executed, since the size of the specified message is exceeded.
- **kMostXML4CAPLUnknownParamAdr = -33**: The specified parameter address cannot be dissolved with the available function catalogs.
- **kMostXML4CAPLParamNotFoundInMsg = -34**: A parameter with the indicated address cannot be found in the message.
- **kMostXML4CAPLParamTypeMismatch = -35**: The function has attempted to read a value that does not have the compatible data type.
- **kMostXML4CAPLEncodingMismatch = -36**: The function cannot read the string or raw data, since the coding does not match.
