## Application Socket API

### Function Blocks

- **mostApRegister**: Registers a CAPL node at the Application Socket as function block.
- **mostApRegisterEx**: Registers a function block at the local function block list.
- **mostApUnregister**: Removes the function block assigned to a CAPL node from the Application Socket.
- **mostApUnregisterEx**: Removes a function block from the local function block list.

### Status

- **mostApGetFBlockID**: Returns the function block identifier (FBlockID) of the CAPL node.
- **mostApGetInstID**: Returns the instance identifier (InstID) of the CAPL node.
- **mostApIsAddressed**: Checks whether the functional MOST address {fblockID, instID} matches the CAPL node function blocks.
- **mostApIsRegistered**: Checks whether a function block assigned to the CAPL node is registered at the Application Socket.
- **mostApIsRegisteredEx**: Checks whether a function block is registered at the Application Socket.

### Read-Out of the Registries

The registries of the Application Socket may be read-out during the entire measurement cycle. For this purpose CAPL provides the following functions:

- **mostAsRgGetSize**: Returns the number of entries in the desired registry.
- **mostAsRgGetRxTxLog**: Returns the logical node address of a specific entry in the desired registry.
- **mostAsRgGetFBlockID**: Returns the FBlockID of a specific entry in the desired registry.
- **mostAsRgGetInstID**: Returns the InstID of a specific entry in the desired registry.

The 'regsel' parameter is used to select the desired registry:

- regsel = 1: [Local FBlockList](../../CANoeCANalyzer/MOST/MOSTSimulationApplicationSocketLocalFBlockList.md)
- regsel = 2: [Bus Registry](../../CANoeCANalyzer/MOST/MOSTSimulationApplicationSocketBusRegistry.md)

**Please note:** The Bus Registry is created in each device during MOST system configuration. It is only valid during network status 'ConfigOk'. Generally the NetworkMaster administers the Central Bus Registry. The Network Slaves mirror it in their De-Central Bus Registry.

Changes to registries are signaled in CAPL by the [OnMostAsRegistry()](EventProcedures/CAPLfunctionOnMOSTAsRegistry.md) event procedure.
